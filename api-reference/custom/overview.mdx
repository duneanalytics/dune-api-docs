Custom Endpoints allow developers to create and manage API endpoints from Dune queries. By selecting a query and scheduling it to run at a specified frequency, developers can call a custom URL to consume data. This flexible alternative to [Preset Endpoints](.././overview/introduction#preset-endpoints) provides greater customization without the complexities of [SQL Endpoints](.././overview/introduction#sql-endpoints).

## How to Create a Custom Endpoint

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "69.583%", // Aspect ratio of 1200 by 835
    height: 0,
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/3QNIjH9kzMGhCF6ejAJl?embed"
    title="Parameter demo"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
    }}
  />
</div>

<Note>
- The custom endpoint shares the same refresh schedule as the underlying query. Changing the query schedule will also change the endpoint schedule, and vice versa. See [scheduling queries](../../web-app/query-editor/query-scheduler) for more info.
- All your custom endpoints can be found in `Library` > `Custom endpoints`.
</Note>

<Warning> 
You can only create endpoints from queries you own. Creating endpoints from others' queries can lead to changes in the logic without notification, breaking your data consumption pipeline.
</Warning>

<Tip>  
- Leverage [Filtering](../executions/filtering), [Sorting](../executions/sorting), and [Sampling](../executions/sampling) to flexibly grab query results. 
- Use [Pagination](../executions/pagination) to handle large results.
</Tip>

### Credits Consumption

Custom endpoints consume credits in two ways:
1. **Refresh schedule:** Credits are consumed based on the engine size (e.g., 10 credits per refresh for medium, 20 credits for large). The monthly credit consumption is shown during endpoint creation.
2. **Data fetch:** Credits are charged based on the datapoints read from the endpoint. Utilize result filtering to consume fewer credits by reading fewer datapoints.
