title: 'Hosted Blockchain Integration'
---

Blockchain integrations on Dune are offered through two options: **"Fully Managed"** and **"Hosted"**. While the **"Fully Managed"** service involves comprehensive management by Dune, the **"Hosted"** option allows blockchain teams to upload their blockchain data using dedicated blockchain endpoints.

<Info>  
Access to these dedicated endpoints is exclusive to the **enterprise plan**. For more information, [contact our integrations team](https://dune.com/enterprise).

## Endpoints

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card
    title="Insert Endpoint"
    icon="upload"
    href="./insert"
  >
    This endpoint facilitates upload of raw blockchain data to content specific tables (`blocks`, `transactions`, `logs`, `traces`) with predefined schemas.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Clear Endpoint"
    icon="trash"
    href="./clear"
  >
    This endpoint allows for the removal of all data within a blockchain table.
  </Card>
  <Card
    title="Delete Endpoint"
    icon="bullseye-pointer"
    href="./delete"
  >
    This endpoint will enable targeted deletion within a table, providing more granularity than the `Clear` endpoint.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>


## Limitations 

    - Currently, these endpoints only support EVM-compatible chains.
    - These endpoints are optimized for micro-batch uploads, featuring sub-second processing times and supporting a maximum batch size of approximately 1.2GB â€” ideal for chains with block times of 1-2 seconds.
