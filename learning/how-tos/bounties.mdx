Dune has engineered the tools for extracting insights from cryptocurrency data, but it's the prowess and courage of our Wizard community that brings this data to light, making it accessible and understandable for projects and the general public alike. Many Wizards seek opportunities to monetize their skills and enhance their reputation in the domain.

## Wizards + Projects: A Disconnect

Projects are in dire need of data insights, while Wizards are on the lookout for opportunities. Bridging them has been challenging.

The search for analytics tasks sprawls across various platforms such as Twitter, Discord, Gitcoin, Layer3, Notion boards, and other less visible corners of the internet.

This dispersion makes it challenging for **Wizards** to pinpoint where to find potential engagements, creating unnecessary obstacles in the application and project delivery processes.

For **Projects**, this scattered landscape complicates the process of identifying the ideal Wizard for their needs, adding undue complexity to project management.

The core of this issue is resolved by establishing a unified marketplace to streamline the engagement between Wizards and Projects, facilitating the seamless flow of data.

This marketplace is designed to efficiently manage:

- Task allocation
- Application procedures
- Communication channels
- Reputation management
- Financial transactions

while embracing a web3 native approach.

**Fortunately, such a marketplace now exists!**

## Dune Bounties: The Solution

By utilizing [dework.xyz](https://www.dework.xyz), we've crafted a bounty board specifically for managing bounty programs!

Dework is described as a “web3 native Trello with integrated payments and credentialing". But what does this entail?

Hear it from Lonis, the co-founder of Dework:

Dework provides the infrastructure for us to outline tasks on our [board](https://app.dework.xyz/dune/board), enabling other organizations to effortlessly connect with Dune Wizards by simply tagging “Dune Analytics” as a required skill.

All tasks labeled with the Dune Analytics skill will be visible in the [Dune hub](https://app.dework.xyz/hubs/dune), simplifying the process for Wizards to discover tasks that match their expertise.
