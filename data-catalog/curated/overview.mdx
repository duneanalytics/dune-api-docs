## Overview 

Dune and its community are building a collection of curated data tables that make it easier to query and analyze blockchain data. These tables are built using dbt, a tool that allows you to transform data in your warehouse using SQL and Jinja templating. We sometimes refer to these tables as _spells_ and the collection of them as _spellbook_.

The curated data tables are built on top of raw data tables and provide a high-level view of the data. For example, the `dex.trades` table aggregates data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of all trades on decentralized exchanges.

The curated data tables are maintained in the [Spellbook repository](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook) and are available for anyone to use. You can find the documentation and code for each table in the [Spellbook Docs](https://spellbook-docs.dune.com/).

Here is a non-exhaustive list of some of the curated data tables available in Spellbook:

## Benefits of curated data Tables

Curated data tables provide several benefits:

- **Simplified Queries**: curated data tables make it easier to query and analyze blockchain data by providing a high-level view of the data.
- **Consistent Data Models**: The curated data tables follow a consistent data model, making it easier to combine data from different sources.
- **Community Contributions**: The curated data tables are maintained by the Dune community, so anyone can contribute to them and improve the data quality.
