# Blockchain Data

Dune provides data for a wide range of blockchains. Our data catalog includes raw data, decoded data, and abstracted data tables for each blockchain.

### EVM Chains

We provide the most comprehensive data catalog for Ethereum Mainnet and EVM-compatible rollups, sidechains and other layer 2 solutions. 
All EVM chains on Dune have raw data, decoded data and abstracted data tables available.

# Curated 

Dune provides a wide range of curated tables that simplify the process of querying and analyzing blockchain data. These tables are built on top of raw and decoded data tables and provide a high-level view of the data.
