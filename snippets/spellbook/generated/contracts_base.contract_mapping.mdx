</ParamField>
<ParamField path="contract_name">

</ParamField>
<ParamField path="creator_address">
Highest-level contract creator address (i.e. which address deployed the factory which deployed contracts), or the tx_from when the contract creator address is non-deterministic.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="trace_deployer_address">
Attribution to the mapped deployer address at the creation trace, handles for ~most deterministic deployers and smart wallet creations.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="created_time">
contract creation time

Contract creation transaction from address
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="created_tx_to">
Contract creation transaction to address
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="created_tx_method_id">
Method ID of the transaction. This is useful for determining how a contract was deployed (i.e Safe transaction vs traditional deployment)

</ParamField>
<ParamField path="code_bytelength">
Length of the deployed code, measured in bytes. This is used for spam filtering
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="token_standard">
What token standard the contract is. For non-tokens, this field will be null.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="code">
Runtime bytecode of the contract
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="code_deploy_rank_by_chain">
Was this the 1st, 2rd, 3rd, etc time the same exact bytecode was deployed by chain? (1 &#x3D; 1st). This can be used for spam filtering.
