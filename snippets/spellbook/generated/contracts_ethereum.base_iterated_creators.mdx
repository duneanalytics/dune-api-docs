<ParamField path="blockchain">
Name of chain in Dune database
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="trace_creator_address">
Address creating the contract in the transaction trace
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="creator_address">
Highest-level contract creator address (i.e. which address deployed the factory which deployed contracts), or the tx_from when the contract creator address is non-deterministic.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="trace_deployer_address">
Attribution to the mapped deployer address at the creation trace, handles for ~most deterministic deployers and smart wallet creations.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="contract_address">
Address of the contract
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="created_time">
contract creation time
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="created_month">
Monthly partition, when the contract was created
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="top_level_contract_address">
Top-Level contract address
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="top_level_time">
Top-Level contract creation transaction block time
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="created_tx_hash">
Contract creation transaction hash
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="created_block_number">

</ParamField>
<ParamField path="top_level_tx_to">
Top-Level contract creation transaction to address
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="top_level_tx_method_id">
Method ID of the top-level transaction. This is useful for determining how the top-level contract was deployed (i.e Safe transaction vs traditional deployment)
</ParamField>

</ParamField>
<ParamField path="created_tx_index">
Index of the contract creation transaction within its block
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="code_bytelength">
Length of the deployed code, measured in bytes. This is used for spam filtering
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="code_deploy_rank_by_chain">

</ParamField>
<ParamField path="code">
Runtime bytecode of the contract
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="is_self_destruct">
Flag if it is a self destruct contract
